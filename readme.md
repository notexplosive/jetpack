# Limbo Game Engine Template

This is the template for the wrapper to run the Limbo engine.

## Why

This template gives you the following:

- This is a ready-to-use pixi.js + typescript + webpack setup.
- It also (optionally) includes [Limbo](https://github.com/notexplosive/limbo), my pixi.js game engine, if you don't want this you can just delete the directory after you clone the template. (at time of writing Limbo is in _very_ early development, it probably isn't useful to you)
- You can run `npm start` and get a hot-reloaded development environment
- You can run `npm build` and get a production build ready for itch.io

## How do I use it?

To run this template you'll need the latest version of Node (last confirmed working versions are `npm 8.12.1` and `node 16.15.1`).

- Select `Use This Template` above.
- Walk through the flow of creating a repo.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to get a dev environment
- Start writing code in `src/mygame/main.ts`
